# Leaky-Bucket-Algorithm


Computer Graphics is one of the most effective and commonly used methods to
communicate the processed information to the user. It displays the information in
the form of graphical objects such as pictures, charts, graphs and diagram instead of
simple text.


The Leaky bucket Is an algorithm based on an analogy of how a bucket with a leak
will overflow if either the average rate at which water is poured in exceeds the rate
at which the bucket leaks or if more water than the capacity of the bucket is poured
in all at once, and how the water leaks from the bucket at an (almost) constant rate
It is used in packet switched computer networks and telecommunications networks
in both the traffic policing and traffic shaping of data transmissions, in the form of
packets.

It can also be used as a scheduling algorithm to determine the timing of
transmissions. The leaky bucket algorithm is also used in leaky bucket counters. The
leaky bucket as a meter can be used in either traffic shaping or traffic policing. For
example, in ATM networks.
